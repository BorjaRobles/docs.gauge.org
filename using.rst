Using Gauge
===========

Gauge is a first class command line tool. This means that you can
operate entirely from the command line. Or, if you prefer to use an IDE
then Gauge also has excellent integration with multiple IDEs.

Help
----

To find all the Gauge commands and their usages, have a look at Gauge's `manpage <https://manpage.gauge.org/>`__.

``gauge`` command can be used to find the command references.

.. code-block:: console

   gauge help

The command-line interface works across platforms. On GNU/Linux and OSX,
you can use any terminal. On Windows, you can use ``cmd`` or Powershell.

Creating a project
------------------

To create or initialize a Gauge project use run

.. code-block:: console

   gauge init <template>

You can also create a project right from your the 
IDE(`Visual Studio Code <https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-vscode/blob/master/README.md#create-new-project>`__,
`Intellij <https://github.com/getgauge/Intellij-Plugin/blob/master/README.md#creating-a-java-project>`__,
Visual Studio).

Gauge Project Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gauge provides templates that can be used to bootstrap the process of
initializing a Gauge project along with a suitable build dependency
tool, webdriver etc.

To list all the Gauge project templates available, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge init --templates

These templates can also be found in `Bintray Gauge Templates <https://bintray.com/gauge/Templates/gauge-templates/view#files>`__.

Initialize a Gauge project with Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, to start writing a Gauge project with Java as language for
writing test code and Selenium as driver, a Gauge template 
``java_maven_selenium`` is available.These templates help getting started
to write tests easily.

To initialize a Gauge project with a template, choose a name from the
list shown on running ``gauge init --templates`` and pass that name as
an argument when initializing the Gauge project.

For example, to create a Gauge project with the ``java_maven_selenium``
template, run this command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge init java_maven_selenium

This template creates a Gauge project with Maven as build tool and the
selenium Webdriver. This will download the Gauge template
``java_maven_selenium`` and setup your project with useful sample code.

Now, you can start writing :ref:`Specifications <spec_syntax>` and
execute them.


.. _project_structure:

Project Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On initialization of a gauge project for a particular language a project
skeleton is created with the following files

Common Gauge files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _gauge_project_root:

``GAUGE_PROJECT_ROOT`` environment variable holds the path in which the Gauge project is created.

.. code-block:: text

    ├── env
    │  └── default
    │     └── default.properties
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── specs
       └── example.spec

Env Directory
"""""""""""""

The env directory contains multiple environment specific directories.
Each directory has `.property files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties>`__ which define the environment variables set during execution for that specific environment.

A **env/default** directory is created on project initialization which
contains the default environment variables set during execution.

Learn more about :ref:`managing environments <environments>`.

Specs Directory
"""""""""""""""

The specs directory contains all :ref:`spec <spec_syntax>` files for the
project. They are the business layer specifications written in simple
markdown format.

A simple example spec (**example.spec**) is created in the specs
directory to better understand the format of specifications.

Learn more about :ref:`spec <spec_syntax>`.

Manifest file
"""""""""""""

The **manifest.json** contains gauge specific configurations which
includes the information of plugins required in the project.

After project initialization, the ``manifest.json`` will have the
following content.

.. code:: js

   {
     "Language": "<language>",
     "Plugins": [
       "html-report"
     ]
   }

-  **language** : Programming language used for the test code. Gauge uses the 
corresponding language runner for executing the specs.

-  **Plugins** : The gauge plugins used for the project. Some plugins are used by default 
on each gauge project. The plugins can be added to project by running the following command :

  .. code:: console

      gauge install <plugin-name>

  Example :

  .. code:: console

      gauge install xml-report

After running the above command, the manifest.json would have the
following content:

.. code:: js

   {
     "Language": "<language>",
     "Plugins": [
       "html-report",
       "xml-report"
     ]
   }

Project files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a new project adds some language specific files.

.. _executing_tests:

Executing tests
---------------

Inside a Gauge project, you can execute your tests by invoking 
``gauge`` with path to :ref:`specifications <spec_syntax>`. 
By convention, specifications are stored in the the ``./specs/`` 
sub-directory in the project root.

The syntax is:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run [flags] <path-to-specs>

The ``gauge`` command-line utility allows multiple ways to specify the
specifications to be executed. A valid path for executing tests can be
path to directories that contain specifications or path to specification
files or path to scenarios or a mix of any of these three methods.

To execute all the tests in a given folder ``specs``, use

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/

This will give a colored console output with details of the execution as
well an execution summary.

The path of specifications can also be specified through an environment variable <path>.
This changes the default specification directory from ``specs`` to the value defined in the environment variable. 

Gauge specifications can also be run from within the IDE
(`Visual Studio Code <https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-vscode/blob/master/README.md#run-specifications-and-scenarios>`__,
`IntelliJ IDEA <https://github.com/getgauge/Intellij-Plugin/blob/master/README.md#execution>`__, Visual Studio)

Specify scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A single scenario of a specification can be executed by specifying the
line number in the span of that scenario in the spec. To execute a
``Admin Login`` scenario in the following spec use
``gauge run specs/login_test.spec:4`` command.

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: specify_scenario
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    # Configuration    

    ## Admin Login
    * User must login as "admin"
    * Navigate to the configuration page

This executes only the scenario present at line number ``3`` i.e
``Admin Login`` in ``login_test.spec``. In the above spec, specifying
line numbers 3-5 will execute the same scenario because of the span.

Multiple scenarios can be executed selectively as follows :

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/helloworld.spec:3 specs/anotherhelloworld.spec:5

These scenarios can also belong to different specifications.

You can also specify a specific :ref:`scenario <scenario_syntax>` or a 
list of scenarios to execute. To execute scenarios, ``gauge`` takes 
path to a specification file, followed by a colon and the line number 
of the scenario. You may specify any line number which the scenario 
spans across. For example, in the above spec file, both the below 
commands will run the same scenario.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/helloworld.spec:3 # Runs scenario 'Admin Login'
    gauge run specs/helloworld.spec:5 # Runs scenario 'Admin Login'

Consider a specification file, ``spec1.spec`` defined as such,

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: specify_scenario
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    # Configuration    

    ## Admin Login
    * User must login as "admin"
    * Navigate to the configuration page

    ## User Login
    * User must login as "user1"
    * Navigation to configuration page is restricted.

For example, to execute the second scenario of a specification file
named ``spec1.spec``, you would do:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec:3

To specify multiple scenarios, add multiple such arguments. For example,
to execute the first and second scenarios of a specification file named
``spec1.spec``, you would do:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec:3 specs/spec1.spec:7

Specify directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify a single directory in which specifications are stored.
Gauge scans the directory and picks up valid specification files.

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/

You can also specify multiple directories in which specifications are
stored. Gauge scans all the directories for valid specification files
and executes them in one run.

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs-dir1/ specs-dir2/ specs-dir3/

Specify files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify path to a specification files. In that case, Gauge
executes only the specification files provided.

For example, to execute a single specification file:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec

Or, to execute multiple specification files:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec specs/spec2.spec specs/spec3.spec


Verbose reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``gauge`` reports at the specification level when executing
tests. You can enable verbose, step-level reporting by using the
``--verbose`` flag. For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --verbose specs/


.. _table_driven_execution:

Data driven execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  A *data table* is defined in markdown table format in the beginning
   of the spec before any steps.
-  The data table should have a header row and one or more data rows
-  The header names from the table can be used in the steps within
   angular brackets ``< >`` to refer a particular column from the data
   table as a parameter.
-  On execution each scenario will be executed for every data row from
   the table.
-  Table can be easily created in IDE using template
   ``table:<no of columns>``, and hit ``Tab``.
-  Table parameters are written in Multi-markdown table formats.

For example,

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: data_driven

    # Table driven execution

         |id| name    |
         |--|---------|
         |1 |vishnu   |
         |2 |prateek  |
         |3 |navaneeth|

    ## Scenario
    * Say "hello" to <name>

    ## Second Scenario
    * Say "namaste" to <name>

In the above example the step uses the ``name`` column from the data
table as a dynamic parameter.

Both ``Scenario`` and ``Second Scenario`` are executed first for the
first row values ``1, vishnu`` and then consecutively for the second and
third row values from the table.

External CSV for data table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Tables for a specification can also be passed from an external CSV file. 
The parameter contains a prefix table and the path to the csv file.

**Prefix** : The prefix is table

**Value** : The value is the path to the csv file. This can be absolute file path or relative to project.


For example,

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: data_driven

    # Table driven execution

    table: /system/users.csv

    ## Scenario
    * Say "hello" to <name>

    ## Second Scenario
    * Say "namaste" to <name>


In the above example the step uses the ``name`` column from the csv file.

Execute selected data table rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, scenarios in a spec are run against all the data table rows.
It can be run against selected data table rows with flag
``--table-rows`` and specifying the row numbers against which the
scenarios should be executed. If there are multiple row numbers, they
should be separated by commas.

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --table-rows "1" specs/hello.spec
    gauge run --table-rows "1,4,7" specs/hello.spec

Range of table rows can also be specified, against which the scenarios
are run.

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --table-rows "1-3" specs/hello.spec

This executes the scenarios against table rows 1, 2, 3.

.. _tagged_execution:

Tagged Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tags allow you to filter the specs and scenarios quickly for execution.
To execute all the specs and scenarios which are labelled with certain
tags, use the following command.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --tags tag1,tag2 specs

or,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --tags "tag1, tag2" specs

This executes only the scenarios and specifications which are tagged
with ``tag1`` and ``tag2``.

Example:

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: tagged_execution

    # Search Specification

    The admin user must be able to search for available products on the search page.

    Tags: search,  admin

    * User must be logged in as "admin"
    * Open the product search page

    ## Successful search

    Tags: successful

    For an existing product name, the search result will contain the product name.

    * Search for product "Die Hard"
    * "Die Hard" should show up in the search results

    ## Unsuccessful search

    On an unknown product name search, the search results will be empty

    * Search for product "unknown"
    * The search results will be empty


In the above spec, if all the scenarios tagged with "search" and "successful"
should be executed, then use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --tags "search & successful" SPEC_FILE_NAME # Runs scenario 'Successful search' only

Execution hooks can also be filtered based on tags. 
See :ref:`filtering hooks with tags <_filtering_hooks_with_tags>` for more information.

Tag expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tags can be selected using expressions. Examples:

================================== ===============================================================
Tags                               Selects specs/scenarios that
================================== ===============================================================
``!TagA``                          do not have ``TagA``
``TagA & TagB``                    have both ``TagA`` and ``TagB``.
``TagA & !TagB``                   have ``TagA`` and not ``TagB``.
``TagA | TagB``                    have either ``TagA`` or ``TagB``.
``(TagA & TagB) | TagC``           have either ``TagC`` or both ``TagA`` and ``TagB``
``!(TagA & TagB) | TagC``          have either ``TagC`` or do not have both TagA and TagB
``(TagA | TagB) & TagC``           have either [``TagA`` and ``TagC``] or [``TagB`` and ``TagC``]
================================== ===============================================================


.. _parallel_execution:

Parallel Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specs can be executed in parallel to run the tests faster and distribute
the load.

This can be done by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --parallel specs

or,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -p specs

This creates a number of execution streams depending on the number of
cores of the machine and distribute the load among workers.

The number of parallel execution streams can be specified by ``-n``
flag.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --parallel -n=4 specs

This creates four parallel execution streams.

.. note:: The number of streams should be specified depending on number of CPU 
cores available on the machine, beyond which it could lead to undesirable results. 
For optimizations, try `parallel execution using threads`_.

.. _parallel execution using threads:

Parallel Execution using threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In parallel execution, every stream starts a new worker process. This can be optimized 
by using multithreading instead of processes. This uses only one worker process and 
starts multiple threads for parallel execution.

To use this, Set `enable_multithreading` env var to true. 
This property can also be added to the default/custom env.

.. code-block:: text

    enable_multithreading = true

**Requirements:**

* Thread safe test code.
* Language runner should support multithreading.

.. note:: Currently, this feature is only supported by Java language runner/plugin.

Executing a group of specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifications can be distributed into groups and ``--group`` \| ``-g``
flag provides the ability to execute a specific group.

This can be done by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

This creates 4 groups (provided by -n flag) of specification and selects
the 2nd group (provided by -g flag) for execution.

Specifications are sorted by alphabetical order and then distributed
into groups, which guarantees that every group will have the same set of
specifications, no matter how many times it is being executed.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

The above two commands will execute the same group of specifications.

Rerun one execution stream
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Specifications can be distributed into groups and ``--group`` \| ``-g``
flag provides the ability to execute a specific group.

This can be done by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

This creates 4 groups (provided by ``-n`` flag) of specification and
selects the 2nd group (provided by ``-g`` flag) for execution.

Specifications are sorted by alphabetical order and then distributed
into groups, which guarantees that every group will have the same set of
specifications, no matter how many times it is being executed.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

The above two commands will execute the same group of specifications.


Run your test suite with lazy assignment of tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This features allows you to dynamically allocate your specs to streams
during execution instead of at the start of execution.

This allows Gauge to optimise the resources on your agent/execution
environment. This is useful because some specs may take much longer than
other, either because of the number of scenarios in them or the nature
of the feature under test

The following command will assign tests lazily across the specified
number of streams:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 --strategy="lazy" specs

or,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 specs

Say you have 100 tests, which you have chosen to run across 4
streams/cores; lazy assignment will dynamically, during execution,
assign the next spec in line to the stream that has completed it's
previous execution and is waiting for more work.

Lazy assignment of tests is the default behaviour.

Another strategy called ``eager`` can also be useful depending on need.
In this case, the 100 tests are distributed before execution, thus
making them an equal number based distribution.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 --strategy="eager" specs

.. note:: The 'lazy' assignment strategy only works when you do NOT use
the -g flag. This is because grouping is dependent on allocation of
tests before the start of execution. Using this in conjunction with a
lazy strategy will have no impact on your test suite execution.


Re-run failed tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gauge provides you the ability to re-run only the scenarios which failed
in previous execution. Failed scenarios can be run using the
``--failed`` flag of Gauge.

Say you run ``gauge run specs`` and 3 scenarios failed, you can run re-run
only failed scenarios instead of executing all scenarios by following
command.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --failed

This command will even set the flags which you had provided in your
previous run. For example, if you had executed command as

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env="chrome" --verbose specs

and 3 scenarios failed in this run, the ``gauge run --failed`` command sets
the ``--env`` and ``--verbose`` flags to corresponding values and
executes only the 3 failed scenarios. In this case ``gauge run --failed`` is
equivalent to command

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env="chrome" --verbose specs <path_to_failed_scenarios>


Errors during execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parse errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This occurs if the spec or concept file doesn't follow the 
expected :ref:`specifications <spec_syntax>` or :ref:`concepts <concept_syntax>` syntax.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: text

    [ParseError] hello_world.spec : line no: 25, Dynamic parameter <product> could not be resolved

Validation Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are errors for which `Gauge` skips executing the spec where the error occurs.

There are two types of validation error which can occurs

    1. Step implementation not found
        If the spec file has a step that does not have an implementation in the projects programming language.
    2. Duplicate step implementation
        If the spec file has a step that is implemented multiple times in the projects.

**Example**

.. code-block:: text

    [ValidationError] login.spec:33: Step implementation not found. login with "user" and "p@ssword"

.. code-block:: text

    [ValidationError] foo.spec:11 Duplicate step implementation => 'Vowels in English language are <table>'


Refactoring
-----------

Rephrase steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gauge allows you to rephrase a step across the project. To rephrase a
step run:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge refactor "old step <name>" "new step name"

Here ``<`` and ``>`` are used to denote parameters in the step.
**Parameters can be added, removed or changed while rephrasing.**

This will change all spec files and code files (for language plugins
that support refactoring).

For example,

Let's say we have the following steps in our ``spec`` file:

.. code-block:: gauge

    * create user "john" with id "123"
    * create user "mark" with id "345"

Now, if we now need to add an additional parameter, say ``last name``,
to this step we can run the command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge refactor "create user <name> with id <id>" "create user <name> with <id> and last name <watson>"

This will change all spec files to reflect the change.

.. code-block:: gauge

    * create user "john" with id "123" and last name "watson"
    * create user "mark" with id "345" and last name "watson"
